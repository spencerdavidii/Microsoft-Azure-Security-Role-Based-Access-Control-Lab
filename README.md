### Objectives
- Built and documented a hands-on lab using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to create and manage user identities, security groups, and role assignmentsâ€”demonstrating core identity and access management skills in a cloud-based environment.
- Gained hands-on experience with cloud-based identity and access management (IAM)
- Demonstrated understanding of user provisioning, group policy, and secure access controls
- 

- ### Skills Learned
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) fundamentals  
- User provisioning and account creation in Microsoft Entra ID  
- Group creation and permission assignment  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) setup  
- Navigating and using the Azure Portal effectively  
- Understanding cloud-based vs. on-prem Active Directory  
- Hands-on experience with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)  
- Secure access and user management best practices  

In this lab, I will show how users and groups are created vin Microsoft Azure environments.Identity and Access are at the core of how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) works in Microsoft Azure.

In Azure; an identity can include a user, a group, and a service principal.

For instance, I created my own fictional IT company located in Cncinnati, Ohio called TigerSpeedTechnologies. We just hired an IT Support Services Director named Nathan Johnson. 

In the screenshow below, I demonstrate adding him to become a user for the company TigerspeedTechnologoies.

Additionally, I helped the IT director with his first day login process into the computer as well. I set a temporary password for him to sign into the computer then change it to a permanent secure password. =

Next, I added Nathan Johnson to a Senior Adminstrator group and made changes to the systems to make him the group owner.

From that exercise, I learned how to manage user identities and organize access using Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal. I created a user account from scratch and added that user to a security group, which taught me how companies can efficiently control access to resources. 

I saw how using groups makes it easier to manage roles and permissions for multiple users at once, instead of individually.

It also showed me how access can be structured securely and clearly, which is important in protecting company data. Overall, I learned the importance of centralized identity and access management in keeping IT systems organized and secure.

You used the Azure Portal to create a user and a group, and assigned the user to the group.
